# Community Clustering Merge


## Overview

**Community Clustering Merge** is a Python library designed to seamlessly merge the results of multiple clustering algorithms into a unified community structure. Leveraging the efficiency of the Union-Find (Disjoint Set) data structure, this tool ensures accurate and optimized merging of overlapping and intertwined clusters, while effectively handling edge cases such as invalid cluster identifiers.

## Features

- **Efficient Merging**: Utilizes the Union-Find algorithm for optimal performance during merging operations.
- **Handling Invalid Clusters**: Properly manages entities not assigned to any cluster across all clustering results (e.g., cluster ID `0`).
- **Minimal Cluster ID Assignment**: Assigns the smallest valid cluster ID within merged groups for consistency.
- **Scalable**: Suitable for large-scale datasets with multiple clustering results.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for integrating with existing data pipelines.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Includes extensive test cases covering simple, complex, and edge scenarios.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable to incorporate additional merging strategies.
